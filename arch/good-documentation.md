# üß≠ 1. Principles of Good Technical Documentation

Good documentation serves as both **a learning resource** and **a reference**. It should enable a developer to:

- **Understand** what the tool does and why it exists,
- **Get started quickly**, and
- **Solve problems independently**.

The core attributes of good developer documentation are:

| Attribute          | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear**          | Uses precise, simple language. Avoids jargon unless defined.       |
| **Concise**        | Focused, minimal fluff. Every sentence should serve a purpose.     |
| **Complete**       | Covers all user journeys: installation ‚Üí usage ‚Üí troubleshooting.  |
| **Consistent**     | Terminology, formatting, and tone are uniform throughout.          |
| **Discoverable**   | Content is well-structured and easily searchable.                  |
| **Up-to-date**     | Reflects the current state of the tool, versioned alongside code.  |
| **Example-driven** | Every concept is reinforced by examples, preferably runnable ones. |

# üß© 2. Documentation Structure for a Developer Tool

A good developer tool‚Äôs documentation typically follows a **progressive structure** ‚Äî from conceptual overview to detailed reference.
Here‚Äôs a recommended hierarchy:

### 2.1. **Landing Page / Overview**

- **What it is:** A short, high-level introduction.
- **Audience:** First-time visitors and potential users.
- **Content includes:**

  - One-line description: _What does this tool do?_
  - Why it exists: _What problem does it solve?_
  - Example use case: A quick, compelling demo snippet.
  - Quick links: Installation ‚Üí Tutorial ‚Üí API Reference.

**Example:**

> MergeWay CLI is a developer tool that lets teams define and manage data entities as JSON schemas directly in Git.
> It bridges non-technical and technical workflows by combining form-based editing with version control.

---

## 2.2. **Getting Started**

- **Goal:** Allow new users to install and run something successfully within minutes.
- **Content includes:**

  - Prerequisites (Node, Python, Go, etc.)
  - Installation instructions (npm/pip/homebrew)
  - First command or minimal configuration
  - Short explanation of output
  - Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

**Tips:**

- Use **copyable code blocks**.
- Include both **local setup** and **CI/CD setup** examples.
- Link to deeper documentation sections at the end (‚ÄúNext steps‚Äù).

---

## 2.3. **Concepts / Architecture**

- **Goal:** Explain the _mental model_ of the tool.
- **Content includes:**

  - Key terms (e.g., ‚ÄúEntity,‚Äù ‚ÄúChangeset,‚Äù ‚ÄúSchema‚Äù)
  - How the tool fits into a larger workflow
  - Diagram of architecture or data flow
  - Explanation of how CLI/API/UI components interact

**Tip:** Use concise diagrams ‚Äî they clarify complex relationships faster than text.

---

## 2.4. **Tutorials (Guides)**

- **Goal:** Provide _step-by-step instructions_ for realistic use cases.
- **Structure:**

  1. What you‚Äôll build or accomplish
  2. Step-by-step instructions
  3. Screenshots or terminal output
  4. Final verification / expected result
  5. Link to reference sections

**Tip:** Keep tutorials focused ‚Äî each should teach one skill or feature.

---

## 2.5. **CLI / API Reference**

- **Goal:** Provide _complete, accurate technical detail_.
- **Content includes:**

  - Command syntax (for CLI)
  - Arguments, flags, and examples
  - Configuration options
  - Return codes or outputs
  - Environment variables
  - For APIs: endpoints, parameters, responses, errors

**Tip:** Auto-generate reference documentation from source or code comments where possible.

---

## 2.6. **Configuration and Integration**

- **Goal:** Explain how to adapt the tool for different environments.
- **Content includes:**

  - Config file format
  - Environment variables
  - Integrations with CI/CD, Docker, GitHub Actions
  - Authentication or permissions setup
  - Advanced settings and overrides

---

## 2.7. **Troubleshooting / FAQ**

- **Goal:** Help users self-diagnose issues.
- **Content includes:**

  - Common error messages and resolutions
  - Logging and debugging techniques
  - Compatibility notes (OS, versions, dependencies)
  - Performance tips

---

## 2.8. **Contributing / Development Guide**

- **Goal:** Enable open-source collaboration.
- **Content includes:**

  - How to build the project locally
  - Testing and linting commands
  - Commit and PR guidelines
  - Branching model
  - Style guide (naming, documentation standards)

---

## 2.9. **Versioning & Changelog**

- **Goal:** Track feature and API changes over time.
- **Content includes:**

  - Versioning scheme (SemVer)
  - Links to specific doc versions
  - ‚ÄúBreaking changes‚Äù notes
  - Migration guides

---

## 2.10. **Appendices**

Optional sections for completeness:

- Glossary
- Security policy
- License
- Contact / Support

---

# ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Writing Guidelines

## Language

- Use **active voice** (‚ÄúRun the command‚Äù not ‚ÄúThe command should be run‚Äù).
- Avoid vague phrases like ‚Äúsimply,‚Äù ‚Äújust,‚Äù or ‚Äúobviously.‚Äù
- Be explicit about results and side effects.

## Formatting

- Use **consistent heading hierarchy** (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3).
- Keep line lengths short (‚â§80‚Äì100 chars).
- Use bullet lists for steps or options.
- Include **copy buttons** for code blocks.

## Examples

- Provide both _minimal_ and _realistic_ examples.
- Label each example clearly:

  - ‚úÖ Example: Minimal setup
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Example: With advanced configuration

## Visuals

- Include concise diagrams where relationships matter (architecture, workflow, lifecycle).
- Use syntax highlighting in code blocks.

# üîÅ 4. Maintenance Practices

| Practice                     | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docs-as-code**             | Keep documentation versioned alongside the source (e.g., in `/docs`). |
| **Automate updates**         | Generate API/CLI docs automatically from source annotations.          |
| **Review with each release** | Treat docs changes as mandatory for new features.                     |
| **Link to issues**           | Use inline references to GitHub issues or PRs when relevant.          |
| **Continuous feedback**      | Provide a ‚ÄúSuggest edit‚Äù or ‚ÄúWas this helpful?‚Äù mechanism.            |

# ‚úÖ Summary

Good documentation:

- **Teaches**, **guides**, and **supports** developers.
- **Evolves** alongside the code.
- **Shows, not tells** ‚Äî with clear examples, visuals, and real workflows.
